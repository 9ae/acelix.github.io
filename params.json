{"name":"Alice Q. Wong","tagline":"Software Portfolio","body":"## Deja Vu\r\nDeja Vu for iOS enhances your video experience to help you quickly find those memorable past times. We achieve this by accessing various voice/image/facial recognition services, ranging from REST-ful APIs to open-source libraries. Facebook friends' faces are machine recognized, their words captioned, and even simple objects identified to provide search terms. Think of it as a personal search engine for everything in your phone. ** This project is one of the top four finalist of Kaltura's VideoXHackathon and winner of the VoiceBase prize **\r\n\r\n[video](http://challengepost.com/software/deja-vu) - [server source code](https://github.com/algobunny/djv)\r\n\r\n## Bowls\r\nBill splitting app for Android.
